"""
This code creates a hash for every chunk and checks to see if that chunk already exists in the
vector database.  We only want one collection in Qdrant, but want to make sure that if a user
selects a document that has already been embedded and stored, it does not get stored again.  We
also add metadata for the document title, so that we can make our retriever focus on documents of
interest.  For example, after some usage, the application might have 20 documents for the user to 
select from.  We want the retriever to be exactly right for the documents that they selected.

This could also be useful if different versions of documents are in existence.  We would not want to
recreate a large vectorstore.  But the user could select the most recent version.
